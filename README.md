# ScreenAI — Universal AI Screen Assistant

> **Capture. Annotate. Ask any AI.** Without leaving your workflow.

ScreenAI is an open-source tool that bridges your screen with any AI. Press a shortcut, annotate what you see, and get instant help — from Claude, GPT, Gemini, Mistral, Grok, or your local Ollama.

No screenshots to upload. No copy-paste. No tab-switching. Just point and ask.

## ✨ Features

- **⌨️ One shortcut** — `Alt+Shift+S` captures your screen, `Alt+Shift+A` selects a region
- **🎨 Annotation tools** — Arrows, rectangles, highlights, freehand drawing, text labels
- **🤖 Multi-AI** — Claude, OpenAI GPT-4o, Gemini, Mistral, Grok, Ollama (local) — your choice
- **💬 Conversations** — Full chat history with context. Continue where you left off
- **🔗 Attach to existing conversations** — New captures join ongoing threads for full context
- **🔒 Privacy-first** — Your API keys, your data, stored locally. We never see anything
- **🌐 Chrome Extension** — Works on any website
- **🖥️ Desktop App** — Works on any app (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Chrome Extension

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Nono81/ScreenAI.git
cd screenai

# 2. Install
npm install

# 3. Build
npm run build

# 4. Load in Chrome
#    → Open chrome://extensions
#    → Enable "Developer mode"
#    → Click "Load unpacked"
#    → Select the dist/ folder
```

Then:
1. Click the ScreenAI icon → **Settings** → Add your API key
2. Press `Alt+Shift+S` on any page
3. Annotate, ask, done ✨

### Desktop App (Tauri)

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust, Node.js
# Install Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli

# Build
cd desktop/src-tauri
cargo tauri build

# Or run in dev mode
cargo tauri dev
```

The app runs in your system tray. Global shortcuts work everywhere.

## 🎯 How It Works

```
1. You're stuck on something
2. Alt+Shift+S → Screen freezes
3. Draw an arrow pointing to the problem
4. Type: "Why isn't this working?"
5. AI sees your screen + annotations → Gives you the answer
6. Close overlay → Back to work
```

### Conversation Flow

Every capture can start a **new conversation** or **continue an existing one**.
The AI receives the full history — all previous screenshots, annotations, and messages —
so it understands the context of your problem even across multiple captures.
